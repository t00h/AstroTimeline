            <h1>A brief overview</h1>

            <ul>

                <li>The Earth went under many geological stages to be able to support life (favourably). Geological time periods, in order of greatest to smallest size, are: (supereon), eon, era, period, epoch, and age (and then chron).</li>
                <li class="slideInList">Hadean Eon</li>
                <li>In the first eon, the Hadean eon, the Earth and Moon formed (the Moon probably formed from another large body, "Theia" colliding with Earth, throwing up material which accreted to form the Moon).</li>
                <li>In the Hadean eon, there were such huge surface temperatures that rock was rarely not molten; this, the partially formed atmosphere, with little oxygen, and frequent asteroid impacts, meant life could seldom exist, if at all (some think it did).</li>
                <li>The Hadean eon lasted from the creation of Earth, ~4.5Ga, to ~4Ga (when the oldest rocks found were formed).</li>
                <li class="slideInList">Archean Eon</li>
                <li>Through the Hadean Eon, the Earth slowly cooled, allowing the oldest rocks (and parts of continents) to form; this defines the start of the Archean Eon.</li>
                <li>By the end of this eon, life had definitely arisen; it is very likely that life began in this eon.</li>
                <li>Although life existed, it was relatively primitive - primarily photosynthesising cyanobacteria - especially at first.</li>
                <li>Conditions were, however, still unfavourable for life; the same aforementioned factors in the Hadean Eon were still present, but to a lesser extent.</li>
                <li>The Archaean eon lasted from 4Ga-2.5Ga.</li>
                <li class="slideInList">Proterozoic Eon</li>
                <li>In the Proterozoic Eon, the air in the atmosphere became oxgenised and there were several ice ages.</li>
                <li>In this time period, we also begin to see advanced single-celled eukaryotes and some multi-ceullular organisms.</li>
                <li>Aerobic photosynthesis (producing O<sub>2</sub>) was probably first developed during this eon (if not beforehand), though exactly when is debated.</li>
                <li>Furthermore, "the Great Oxidation Event" occured ~ 2.4Ga. This is seen as likely being due to the development of aerobic photosynthesis beforehand.</li>
                <li>The Proterozoic Eon lasted from ~2.5Ga-541Ma.</li>
                <li class="slideInList">Phanerozoic Eon</li>
                <li>The Phanerozoic Eon represents the time period from 541Ma to the present.</li>
                <li>Its beginning is defined by the start of the Cambrian period, in the Cambrian explosion, followed by the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event.</li>
                <li>This involves the now common appearance of large, multicellular organisms and their subsequent genetic divergence and further development.</li>
                <li>This eon involved the evolution of fish to become land-dwelling animals, the rise and the fall of the dinosaurs, and of course the rise of humanity.</li>

            </ul><br/><br/>

            I will now examine the biological and physical processes by which life has been enabled to exist, and then the way in which it has developed into its current state.

        <h1>The creation of the universe</h1>
            
            <ul>

            <li>The scientific consensus today is that the Universe was created ~13.8Ga in a "Big Bang".</li>
            <li>This value is worked out from the value of Hubble's constant, <span class="italic">H<sub>0</sub></span>.</li>
            <li>Most scientists today place <span class="italic">H<sub>0</sub></span> as ~72 kms<sup>-1</sup>Mpc<sup>-1</sup> or ~2.34 x 10<sup>-18</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>.</li>
            <li>It should be noted, however, that the value has taken many revisions over time, and is still contested today. It is, furthermore, still subject to a high degree of uncertainty.</li>
            <li>Since s = d ÷ t, and v = H<sub>0</sub> d, d ÷ t = H<sub>0</sub> d<br/>
                ∴ solving for the time since the universe began, T<sub>0</sub>:<br/>
                T<sub>0</sub> = 1 ÷ H<sub>0</sub><br/>
                ∴ T<sub>0</sub> ≈ 1 ÷ 2.34 x 10<sup>-18</sup> ≈ 4.2857 x 10<sup>17</sup>s<br/>
                = 4.2857 x 10<sup>17</sup> ÷ (365 x 24 x 60 x 60) = 1.4012 x 10<sup>10</sup> years = 14.012Ga (≈ 13.8Ga)<br/><br/>
                Note: the inaccuracies in this calculation are likely due to the value for H<sub>0</sub> only having 3 significant figures.<br/>
                It should also be mentioned, however, that "more accurate" calculations would also be subject to the volatile nature of H<sub>0</sub> and its high percentage uncertainty.</li>
            <li>It is also a consensus view that the universe was created in a rapid expansion (no not an explosion) called the "Big Bang" - hence the name "Big Bang Theory".</li>
            <li>The Big Bang Theory also had great influence on the models cosmologists use to describe today's universe; it explained the existence of CMB, and Hubble's law, showing that the Universe appears to be expanding (in turn causing us to postulate the existence of "dark matter"), for instance.</li>
            <li>Due to the subsequent acceptance of Hubble's law, Einstein's cosmological constant in General Relativity (which he used to "fix" the theory - preventing it predicting the universe to be expanding) was redacted (until we started using it to explain the universe's acceleration!).</li>
            <li>Later, Einstein was to call the somewhat clumsy inclusion of the cosmological constant in the otherwise sleek Theory of General Relativity as his "biggest blunder".</li>

        <h1>Earth is born</h1>
            
            <ul>
            <li>The solar system most likely began as a nebula - an approximately uniform cloud of matter, gas and dust, perhaps left over from a supernova.</li>
            <li>This mass, called the "solar nebula", collapsed under the influence of gravity to form a protosun in a rotating disc of matter.</li>
            <li>This gas gained internal kinetic energy, until the resulting temperature (and therefore pressure) was great enough to allow nuclear reactions.</li>
            <li>This formed the Sun as a true star, which contained 99.8% of the total mass of the original nebula (or part of it which formed the solar system).</li>
            <li>The outward pressure or force generated by these reactions balanced the gravity acting on the Sun's mass, causing it to gain an equilibrium.</li>
            <li>The remainder of the nebula which formed the solar system then became an accretion disc which rotated around the Sun.</li>
            <li>All physical objects in the solar system formed from this disc; the force of gravity acted upon the matter in the disc, bringing them together into discrete objects.</li>
            <li>Some of these objects were planetesimals (then becoming protoplanets), which go on to form planets. Other objects formed include sattelites (moons), comets, and asteroids.</li>
            <li>All of these solar objects are thought to form within 50-100 million years of each other, at ~4.5Ga.</li>
            <li>As such, the age of the Earth is approximately the same: ~4.5Ga.</li>
            <li>This age has been found using radioactive (often isochron) dating on Earth and Moon rocks, and meteorites (which also have small grains suggesting they came together under gravity).</li>

        <h1>First life on Earth</h1>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Life is thought to have been created by ~3.8Ga, and definitely by ~3.5Ga.</li>
                <li>People speculate as to the initial form of life, and how it formed; ideas include the RNA, PAH, and Iron-Sulphur "worlds", and the "primordial soup".</li>
                <li>The oldest known microfossils found are ~3.5Ga, and their high complexity implies there was earlier life for some time (to develop this complexity).</li>
                <li>It has been debated whether or not some structures dating from even before this time are microfossils - this remains a possibility.</li>
                <li>Some microfossils are not easily distinguished from artefacts formed abiotically, however; this has led to some controversy and debate in classifying microfossils in the past.</li>

        <h1>Aerobic photosynthesis leads to the GOE</h1>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Aerobic (aka oxygenic) photosynthesis developed at least ~2.5Ga (estimates vary, but generally agree it was before the GOE). This meant O<sub>2</sub> began to be produced en masse, filling the atmosphere.</li>
                <li>The O<sub>2</sub> released by oxygenic photosynthesis (which probably initially occured in cyanobacteria) rapidly increased the percentage of the atmosphere composed of O<sub>2</sub>, leading to the GOE.</li>
                <li>The GOE (Great Oxidation Event) was an extremely rapid increase in oxygen in the atmosphere (at least x1000) that occured ~2.4Ga.</li>
                <li>It has been considered possible that this rapid increase in the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere, and subsequent fall in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, led to the first "Snowball Earth".</li>
                <li>The First "Snowball Earth", aka the Huronian Glaciation, when the Earth was thought to be completely covered in ice ("glaciated"), occurred ~2.3Ga.</li>
                <li>The oxidation of the Earth in the GOE due to the development arguably enabled later diversitifation of organisms.</li>

            <ul>
            <li>The fossil record of Eukaryotes dates back to at least ~2Ga, though it is probable for there to be a fossil record that by this time euakaryotes were abundant: they probably date further back (the exact time is still debated; estimates vary).</li>
            <li>The later divergence of the eukaryotic groups plants, animals, and fungi has been estimated to have occured at ~1.6Ga.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Multicellular organisms are thought to have developed multiple times and independently in various phlogenetic groups; the first multicellular animals are thought to have emerged between 700 and 1000 Ma.</li>
                <li>The 3 split taxons from eukaryotes (plants, animals, fungi) are thought to have evolved seperately after diverging (see last slide), including in the development of multicellular organisms.</li>

                <li>The Second "Snowball Earth" took place ~ 700Ma.</li>
                <li>This was known as the Sturtian glaciation, and most likely caused some species to become extinct, in doing so affecting the course of evolution.</li>

        <h1>The first chordates and vertebrates</h1>
            
            <ul>
            <li>Chordates are a phylum which went on diverge partially into vertebrates, which include the most highly involved animal species. The first conclusive chordate fossils recorded are from ~525Ma, though they are thought to have possibly emerged before 540Ma.</li>
            <li>Vertebrates are a pholognetic group of animals under chordates which have backbones. They emerged around the same period as the larger chordate group, during the Cambrian explosion.</li>
            <li>Due to the remaining debate over a relatively scant fossil record at the time, the origins of vertebrates are usually said to be very roughly in line with chordates, though obviously after chordates first developed: ~525Ma.</li>

            <h1>The Cambrian explosion and GOBE</h1>

            <ul>
            <li>The Cambrian explosion was a period during which an extremely large number of phyla and species of organisms emerged at the beginning of the Cambrian Period(541-485Ma). It lasted from 541-530Ma.</li>
            <li>The Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE) is the label given to the plethora of new species and adaptations made during the Early and Late Ordovician Period (489–443Ma), in between 485 and 460Ma.</li>
            <li>The GOBE involved animals species adapting to live on land rather than at sea for the first time - an extremely important phase of evolution. The next slide will discuss this in more detail.</li>

            <h1>1st plants and animals on land</h1>

            <ul>
            <li>The first animals to walk on land were arthropods: the ancestors of millipedes, centipedes, and some arachnids and insects. Colonisation of fully terrestrial arthropods began by ~430Ma, and evidence appears to show they walked on land by 530Ma.</li>
            <li>It is likely, however, that plants were first on land - and therefore had colonised it - before animals were present there. The oldest land plant fossils found so far are around 472Ma; since plants can't move, colonisation must have also occurred by then.</li>
            <li>The first ancestors of humans to colonise land were tetrapods, an intermediate between fish and terrestrial animals. Their fossil record dates back to 400-380Ma, and they are thought to have fully colonised land from some point since 359Ma.</li>

            <h1>Permian–Triassic extinction</h1>

            <ul>
            <li>The P/T extinction was an extinction event (when multiple species become extinct simultaneously, usually due to one or more common causes).</li>
            <li>It is thought that the P/T extinction may have been caused by changes in the Carbon cycle and temperature.</li>
            <li>Over 95% of marine species were eliminated in this extinction, as well as 70% of terrestrial species.</li>
            <li>This extinction occured towards the end of the Permian period, ending at 251Ma. The length of the extinction is argued, on the scale of tens of thousands of years to a double digit number of million years.</li>

            <ul>
            <li>Similarly to the P/T extinction, the T/J extinction took place at the end of the Triassic period, from 201.5Ma-201.3Ma, before the start of the Jurassic period.</li>
            <li>This was less destructive than the P/T extinction, yet 76% of species and 20% of all families became extinct.</li>
            <li>The T/J extinction event did, however, enable the rise of dinosaurs; after the event, dinosaurs dominated in place of sauropsids.</li>
            <li>The T/J extinction event was possibly caused by increased volcanic activity and climate change and rising sea levels resulting from increased CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere (<a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/">And it's happening again!!</a>).</li>

            <li>The oldest known birds were fossils of Archaeopteryx from approximately 150Ma. Birds as a whole probably originated around this time.</li>

            <li>This involved the extinction of nearly all of the dinosaurs - leading to the beginning of mammals' dominance of Earth.</li>

            <li>This event caused some species in deep sea environments to become extinct, but had relatively little effect on species living in shallow water and land habitats.</li>
            <li>Specifically, the rise in temperature is thought to be due to the oxidation and subsequent release of trapped carbon (as CO<sub>2</sub>).</li>

            <li>It has, however, been difficult to accurately find sufficient fossils of, and map the evolutionary relationships between, the early hominid (and hominin) species to be able to say what the first hominid species was, and when it arose, with a reasonable level of certainty.</li>

            <li>Cuneiform was the first written language, emerging at some point between 3500 and 3000BCE.</li>
            <li>At the same time, the first civilizations appear in Iraq, Egypt, India, and China from 3500BCE onwards.</li>
            <li>Various empires and civilisations rise and fall. Power moves from the East into Europe over time.</li>
            <li>We move from the Antiquity and Middle Ages into the Early Modern Period, leading to the Industrial Revolution.</li>
            <li>We focus on developing technology and enriching quality of life, all the while fighting 2 world wars and a cold war. New politics rise and fall.</li>
            <li>DARPA develops TCP/IP, and then the ARPANET, which became the Internet. The additional applications needed for the World Wide Web (HTTP and HTML) were created by a team led by Sir Tim Berners-Lee from 1989.</li>
            <li>This led to the so-called "Internet Age" we are in today, possibly (but probably not) qualifying us as the or some of the most technologically advanced life ever (the universe is a big place!).</li>
